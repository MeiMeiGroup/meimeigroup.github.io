<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: Aug 13, 2025</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how SoundBoard (or other app under our account) ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We collect the following types of information to improve your experience:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Usage Data (Anonymous):</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the App, such as the features you use, the sounds you play, and session duration. This data is aggregated and anonymized to help us understand user behavior and improve the App.</li>
  <li><strong>Device and Analytics Information:</strong> We may collect non-personally identifiable information about your device, such as its model, operating system version, and an anonymized advertising identifier (like Apple's IDFA). This helps us with analytics, compatibility, and serving relevant ads.</li>
  <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> If you use the "Create My Sound" feature, your audio recordings are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to these recordings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number.</strong></p>

<h2>iCloud Backup & Restore</h2>
<p>The App offers an optional iCloud Backup & Restore feature. If you choose to use this feature, your app data, including your settings and any sounds you have recorded, will be uploaded and stored in your personal iCloud account, which is managed by Apple. We do not have access to the data stored in your iCloud account. Your use of iCloud is subject to Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iCloud Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses third-party services for advertising and analytics. These services may collect their own data. We encourage you to review their privacy policies:</p>
